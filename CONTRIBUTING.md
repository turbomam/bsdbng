## Setup

### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Install uv (Python environment manager)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install just (command runner)
# macOS:
brew install just
# Linux:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://just.systems/install.sh | bash -s -- --to ~/.local/bin

# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/turbomam/bsdbng.git
cd bsdbng
uv sync --all-extras --group dev --group qa
just install-hooks    # install pre-commit hooks
just check            # verify everything works
```

### Windows

If you have nothing installed, follow these steps in order.

#### Step 1: Install Git for Windows

Download and install from https://gitforwindows.org

This gives you `git` and **Git Bash** — a bash shell that `just` needs.
Use Git Bash (not PowerShell or cmd) for all commands below.

#### Step 2: Install uv

Open **Git Bash** and run:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Or if you prefer PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Close and reopen your terminal after installing so `uv` is on your PATH.

#### Step 3: Install just

Option 1 (winget, from PowerShell):
```powershell
winget install Casey.Just
```

Option 2 (pre-built binary): download from
https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html and put it on your PATH.

#### Step 4: Verify

Open **Git Bash** and run:

```bash
git --version
uv --version
just --version
```

All three should print version numbers. If any fails, it's not on your PATH.

#### Step 5: Clone and check

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turbomam/bsdbng.git
cd bsdbng
uv sync --all-extras --group dev --group qa
just check
```

`just check` should pass. If it doesn't, open an issue.

#### Troubleshooting

- **`just` can't find bash**: make sure you're running in Git Bash, not
  PowerShell or cmd. The Justfile uses `bash` as its shell.
- **uv not found after install**: close and reopen your terminal.
- **Execution policy errors**: if PowerShell blocks install scripts, you may
  need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned` once.
  This only affects your user account.
- **Your coding agent works around a missing tool**: don't let it. See
  [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for why and what to do instead.

## Making changes

### 1. Pick an issue

All work starts from a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/turbomam/bsdbng/issues).
Don't start work without one. If you want to do something that doesn't have an
issue, open one first.

### 2. Create a branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b issue-<number>-<short-slug>
# Example: git checkout -b issue-30-aggregate-tables
```

### 3. Write code

- Source code goes in `src/bsdbng/`
- Tests go in `tests/`
- Justfile recipes for new pipeline steps should use the `timed` wrapper

### 4. Run checks before committing

```bash
just check
```

This runs everything: ruff (lint + format), mypy (types), pytest (tests),
linkml lint/validate (schema), bandit (security), deptry (dependencies),
and pip-audit (vulnerabilities).

**All checks must pass.** If something fails, fix it. If you think the
check is wrong, open an issue — don't skip the check.

If you want to auto-fix formatting:

```bash
just format
```

### 5. Commit and push

```bash
git add <your files>
git commit -m "Short description of what and why"
git push -u origin issue-<number>-<short-slug>
```

### 6. Open a PR

- Reference the issue: "Closes #30" in the PR body
- Wait for CI to pass
- Respond to Copilot review comments if any

## What not to do

- Don't commit generated files (`data/raw/*.csv`, `data/studies/*.yaml`,
  `data/derived/*`, `logs/`) — they're gitignored for a reason
- Don't edit `src/bsdbng/datamodel/bsdbng_pydantic.py` by hand — it's
  generated from the schema. Run `just gen-pydantic` after schema changes.
- Don't add `# noqa`, `# type: ignore`, or `# nosec` comments. If the
  check is wrong, fix the code or open an issue about the check.
- Don't add dependencies without discussing them first. This project uses
  a minimal dependency set intentionally.
- Don't use sentinel values (e.g., `NCBITaxon:0`, `"unknown"`, `-1`).
  If data is missing, use `null` or skip the record and log why.

## Useful tools

### yq (recommended)

[yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) (Mike Farah's Go version) is
useful for exploring the YAML output:

```bash
# macOS
brew install yq

# Linux
sudo wget -qO /usr/local/bin/yq https://github.com/mikefarah/yq/releases/latest/download/yq_linux_amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/yq

# Show all taxon names in a study
yq '.experiments[].signatures[].taxa[].taxon_name' data/studies/bsdb_10202341.yaml

# Count experiments
yq '.experiments | length' data/studies/bsdb_10202341.yaml

# Find studies with a specific PMID
grep -rl "pmid: 10202341" data/studies/
```

### jq (for JSON logs)

```bash
# Summarize ingest log skip reasons
jq '[.[] | select(.level == "skip")] | group_by(.reason) | map({reason: .[0].reason, count: length}) | sort_by(-.count)' data/derived/ingest_log.json
```

## Project conventions

- **File types**: CSV (input), YAML (output/schema), Python (code), JSON (logs).
  Nothing else.
- **Identifiers**: all entities have an `id` slot inherited from `NamedThing`.
  Study IDs use `bsdb:` prefix. Taxon IDs use `NCBITaxon:` prefix.
- **No sentinels**: missing data is `null`, not a magic value.
- **Log everything**: every data drop or transformation assumption goes
  to `data/derived/ingest_log.json`.
